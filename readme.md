WebDeveloper - website

This is one of my applications that shows my first steps in programming. It isnâ€™t perfect, but it encourages me to improve my coding skills. It can also show you my current progress. Please look at the "to do list" and "currency converter" applications written in Vanilla JS and React to see my current skills. Enjoy my adventures in the Front-End.
